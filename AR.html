  <div class="ar-p">

    <p1>AR has a lot of different use cases in terms of it's hardware and software potentials and the way it has and could be implemented in two different Industries but right now it's main use case is a demonstration or pre evaluation complex or difficult scenarios</p1>

  <h8>Microsoft HoloLens 2</h8>
  <p>
  the Microsoft hololens has been on the market for two revisions now with general hardware improvements in the second division increasing its view and compute capability Microsoft themselves has very interesting investment in both AR and VR and this was seen in some of the updates in 
  Windows 10 where there are more 3D programs natively built into it e.g. paint 3D which is a free simple program for anyone to use which isn't necessary just for the hololens is it computer on his own this was for the VR headsets 
  that third parties were producing for the Windows 10 creator update which offers a much more cheaper headset but this would also need a computer to use. 
  there are a couple of areas where Microsoft scene is focused in trying to push the HoloLens specific one being an area where it takes over common use for a personal computer such as how the mobile phone industry has done the same,
   visualising complex or instructional examples for engineering, medical and others just as the Google Glass move to after it's difficult release in a domestic market.

  <h3>Magic Leap</h3>
  <p>
  the magically has been developed over a lot of years couple of years and they have decided to change some of the common design trades or methodology in normal AR and VR headsets where some of the alterations lie-in some 
  the simpler methods of changing the headset strap improving and picking their own style seem to be quite impressive and simple which could definitely help with the reduced weight and comfort provided with it which will see the most 
  benefits with people sharing their headset or increased I'm wearing a headset which has been a problem with every headset which are trying to fix with better equal weight reducing the amount of weight on the front of your head which can cause an comfort 
  and strain on your neck with long use cases. one of them more interesting facts about the headset itself is the lenses which have a 3 to 4 scaling unlike the original hololens which has a 16 by 9 which was then updated in the hololens 2 which 
  is 3:2 aspect ratio which Inn reviews seems to be a more comfortable display ratio also one of the things that the lens has is a more natural focusing lens on it which the video below Tested: Magic Leap One Augmented Reality Review! goes into 
  greater detail in explaining the benefits and drawbacks of How It's implemented in to the headset. and one of the last different things about this headset is where the computer components are set in the 
  headset re they are in a small circular box which has a link connected to the headset which you could wear either in your pocket or a strap that could be put on your shoulder which allows the house had to have increased computer capacity 
  compared to other headsets which have to balance the weight and the Heat generated from these component on your head.

  <h8>Tilt Five</h8>
  <p>
the Tilt Five is a lot different compared to the other two it is a Kickstarter created by Jeri Ellsworth who has been in the toy industry for many years and was later brought into valve to help their ar development 
seen as one of the key people who could manage such a task at the quality levels expected by the company there is an interview done by valve News Network where they go into deeper details about some of the conflict that came due to the VR that was 
currently there pushing out the ar team which then LED her to leave the company and started Kickstarter with some of the knowledge that she gained creating the Tilt Five this headset is a lot different because it uses a map to display the 
ar illusion allowing the system to benefit of better Focus more detailed controls and display and also reduce the costs in the headset development as it uses a different concept entirely which relates to both reduce costs and reduced headset restrain
 but also can run off a computer but not connecting to the headset which can cause irritation when using that is an interview below explaining this and how this is a much more simple and easier to use Concepts compared to the other two above which is 
 believed by them to be a lot easier to sell to the domestic market with easy controls a simple design proposal that can achieve what it sets out to do whilst also not being a high price that the public cannot receive a useful benefit of it this is 
 probably one of the most interesting pieces of ar technology coming out in the market right now as it's prospect is solid being a games display unit which can do it quite easily and because it's more reduced cost price it is easier for more people to get 
 involved and share your experience with this and as I experienced it because of the simplicity content can be developed or ported over to the Matt style easier than some of these stand-alone headset switch benefit from their own software but is 
 limited due to the amount of time people can
