<h8>Valve Index</h8>  
  <p>
with valve and HTC working together to create the vive a couple of years ago the partnership ended and valve went on their own way as well as HTC to use the research they gathered over that time to create their 
preferred headset but as valves reputation precedes and most people were interested in their own developed VR headset would be like and they did not disappoint the index is considered one of the best VR headsets on the market 
due to its quality that it can reach and it's display that takes most of the boxes with high refresh rates and pixel density but the one significant drawback that it has is that valve was interested in trying to
give the public the best experience with a simple user interface which led to its high price point but as well has pointed out that they are not making a huge amount of money from it and also the problem in the VR market is that 
experiences are limited and have also a limited market especially in the Game Zone where consumers are still waiting for something that really interests them for spending over Â£2,000 for a headset and a capable enough PC 
to run it which is where a half life Alyx came in which Drew all of their stock after the announcement before Christmas

<h3>Oculus Rift s</h3>
  <p>
with Oculus being one of the initial headset manufacturers to start the new wave of VR headset with a similar path to how the tilt five is starting now using public funding and interest using Kickstarter play 
started with the initial Oculus working with galv and indie game designers to create a buzz around the headset which at the time was considered a reasonably expensive headset which state has some fundamental issues 
which make people feel an easy and had a clunky design but with the continued buzz and interests Facebook acquired Oculus and a couple of key designers from parts of the industry around the world to start creating the new line of headsets 
the Rift s and the Quest the Rift s is considered high and headset for PC users with it being required to tether to a PC and like the quest. the difference between the Rift s and the index is what they are trying to accomplish is a 
completely different goal the is the index has a high initial price and will need a high power computer with it the Rift s is goal is to create a simple and easy use case to get people interested in VR it does not need a 
high power PC to get the maximum performance out of it I can also use steam VR software and also Oculus is owned software which are supplying exclusive games just for Oculus the Oculus also supports 
Inside Out tracking which is a lot easier to set up a headset and is also less demanding in terms of hardware needing to be driven which allows them to have a less cables to reduce the difficulty in setup and initial star or 
a relocation of the headset with only a relative loss in power compared to the valve index

<h8>Samsung Odyssey Plus</h8>
  <p>
the Samsung Odyssey Plus was one of the a couple of hardware developers tasked with creating a VR headset from Microsoft when they put the developers update out which allows more functionality for these headsets within windows 
Samsung headset seems to be one of the better ones out on the market from the hardware developers that were tasked with this due to using a similar control design to the Oculus being able to produce high quality displays which they can 
use now in their headset having dominance in the mobile market which allows them to create a familiar user interface that people can use with a simple user interface that is familiar to their mobile design and a better display technology use 
the Odyssey was considered the best of the Bunch and because it's price continues to drop due to the less than expected sales due to the lack of interest in some of the new Windows designs 
this headset use the best for both worlds in terms of AR and VR capabilities and the possible updates for Windows mixed reality and there is news of a new Odyssey 
coming out which will further drop the price of this one and also having an updated and improved version coming out soon
