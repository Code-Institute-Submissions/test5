Your Project's Name:

AR & VR point of view.

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project:

my project is a Focus on the current state of VR and AR and the upcoming or high end of the market with some professional opinions on the current focus on the markets and the past couple of years where it's or a domestic increase. in terms of what my site will specifically cover it will look at 3 headsets from both AR and VR an overview of what they are and how the market perceives them now


UX

Empathize with the users (learning about the audience) the vr is conside to be the hardcore gamers who have a loarge despoble income or a very high intrecsted in gameing and with the populaty increse of gaming over the last decade with compeded game and youtube
Define the problem (identifying the users' needs) there is a large amout of infomashon on the internet asshle about pc gaming which help first time buys out a lot or gives more insite to expratesd buyers looking to upgrade or chage there setup this website looks at some of the most noteble headests and less consed ones which could be overlooked or not know about
Ideate (generating ideas for design) clean and simple home page with intros to AR & VR with a section below to intres people in whats going on in each space
Prototype (turning ideas into concrete examples)

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.



Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.


simplistic-layout easy for users to navigate

visual aids-more content to understand/increases interest

video content-more detailed information increase content 

product links-more detailed information increase content


In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

increase bootstrap implementation overall on site

adding hover functions to VR and AR images

adding a message board to the index

adding slideshows image layouts to increase size of images and reduced content on Pages




JQuery

reason why use replica instead of getting up at the time was because I was more confident at the start of the year and also it had a faster response so I can see the changes in Real-Time


https://repl.it/@georgeSW/test-2 (on this section I was testing overlaps on the index page which came in handy for both the VR and ar layoutsbut I felt it would be more cleaner without them on the index page)

https://repl.it/@georgeSW/test3 (this one I was messing around the heather trying to correctly align or changing how it will be laid out)

https://repl.it/@georgeSW/test-5 (this was a more completed page but I wanted to clean up the background image and the footer layout)
